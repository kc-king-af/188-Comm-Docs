# NIST-Compliant User Account Modification Procedure

## Objective
To establish a secure and standardized process for modifying user accounts while complying with NIST Special Publication 800-53.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all personnel responsible for modifying user accounts on military information systems.

## Responsibilities

Account Administrator: The individual responsible for modifying user accounts and ensuring adherence to security policies.

## Procedure

1. Account Request:

Users requesting modifications to their accounts must submit an account modification request to the Account Administrator.
The request should detail the specific changes required, the reason for the modification, and any necessary approvals.

2. Authentication:

The Account Administrator must authenticate the user's identity and verify the appropriateness of the requested modifications.

3. Access Control Review:

The Account Administrator conducts an access control review to evaluate the impact of the requested modifications on security and access permissions.
Changes must align with the principle of least privilege (POLP) and NIST SP 800-53 requirements.

4. NIST Compliance:

Ensure that all account modifications adhere to NIST Special Publication 800-53 standards, including security controls, password policies, and authentication mechanisms.
Password-related changes must conform to NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines.

5. User Account Creation:

The Account Administrator executes the approved account modifications, which may include:
Changing access permissions or roles.
Resetting passwords as per password policies.
Updating contact information.
Adjusting other account attributes as needed.

6. Notification:

Notify the user of the account modifications made, including any changes to access permissions, passwords, or contact information.

7. User Training:

If the modifications involve changes to security-related settings (e.g., password changes), ensure that users are informed and trained on any new security requirements or procedures.

8. Account Review:

Periodically review modified user accounts to verify that they remain in compliance with NIST standards and access requirements.
Disable or remove accounts that are no longer needed or pose security risks.

9. Documentation:

Maintain accurate records of all user account modification activities, including modification requests, access control decisions, notifications, and training documentation.

10. Record Keeping:

All records related to user account modifications must be retained in accordance with applicable record retention policies.

11. Audit:

Regularly audit the user account modification process to ensure compliance with NIST standards and organizational security policies.
