# NIST-Compliant User Account Creation Procedure

## Objective
To establish a secure and standardized process for creating user accounts in compliance with NIST Special Publication 800-53.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all personnel responsible for creating user accounts on military information systems.

## Responsibilities

Account Administrator: The individual responsible for creating user accounts and ensuring adherence to security policies.

## Procedure

1. Account Request:

Users requesting new accounts must submit an account request to the Account Administrator.
The account request should include the user's full name, rank, official email address, contact information, and supervisor's approval.

2. Authentication:

The Account Administrator must authenticate the user's identity and verify the supervisor's approval before proceeding.

3. Access Control Review:

The Account Administrator conducts an access control review to determine the appropriate level of access the user should have based on their job responsibilities.
Access control decisions should follow the principle of least privilege (POLP).

4. NIST Compliance:

Ensure that the user account creation process adheres to NIST Special Publication 800-53 standards, including security controls, password policies, and authentication mechanisms.
Passwords must meet NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, and expiration intervals).

5. User Account Creation:

The Account Administrator creates the user account following these steps:
Generate a unique username for the user, typically using a standardized format (e.g., first initial + last name).
Assign a temporary password that the user must change upon first login.
Ensure strong, complex, password requirements are enforced for user created/changed passwords to comply with NIST-63-3 guidelines.
Set appropriate access permissions based on the access control review.

6. Notification:

Notify the user of their new account, including the username and instructions for changing the temporary password.

7. User Training:

Ensure that users are trained on security best practices, including password management and responsible system usage.

8. Account Review:

Conduct periodic reviews of user accounts to ensure they remain in compliance with NIST standards and access requirements.
Disable or remove accounts that are no longer needed or pose security risks.

9. Documentation:

Maintain accurate records of all user account creation activities, including account request forms, access control decisions, and notifications.

10. Record Keeping:

All records related to user account creation and management must be retained in accordance with applicable record retention policies.

11. Audit:

Regularly audit the user account creation process to ensure compliance with NIST standards and organizational security policies.
