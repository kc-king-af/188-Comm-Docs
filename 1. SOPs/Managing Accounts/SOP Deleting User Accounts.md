# NIST-Compliant User Account Disabling Procedure

## Objective
To establish a secure and standardized process for deleting user accounts while complying with NIST Special Publication 800-53.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all personnel responsible for deleting user accounts on military information systems.

## Responsibilities

Account Administrator: The individual responsible for deleting user accounts and ensuring adherence to security policies.

## Procedure

1. Account Request:

Account deletion requests may originate from various sources, including security incidents, personnel changes, or system decommissioning.
Requests must be documented and include the reason for deleting the account. 

**NOTE: it is best practice to disable an account for some period of time before deletion, so that investigation can be conducted as needed and user information is retained. 

2. Authentication:

Verify the authenticity of the account deletion request, ensuring that it is legitimate and authorized.

3. Access Control Review:

Conduct an access control review to assess the impact of deleting the account on system security and access permissions.

4. Backup and Archiving:

Ensure that all data associated with the user account, including files, emails, and records, are securely archived or backed up as required by data retention policies.

5. Notification:

Notify the user, or their supervisor if applicable, of the account's impending deletion, including the reason for the action.
Provide guidance on data retrieval if necessary and any steps the user needs to take.

6. Account Deletion:

Delete the user account promptly following these steps:
Disable login access to the system if not already disabled.
Permanently delete the user account and associated data.
Remove all system privileges and access permissions associated with the account.

7. Change Passwords:

If the account contained sensitive data or the deletion is due to a security incident or breach, change the account's passwords for any other systems or services where the user had access.

8. Documentation:

Maintain accurate records of all user account deletion activities, including the request, access control review, notifications, and actions taken.
Document the date and time of the deletion.

9. Record Keeping:

All records related to user account deletion must be retained in accordance with applicable record retention policies.

10. Audit:

Regularly audit the user account deletion process to ensure compliance with NIST standards and organizational security policies.
Conduct post-deletion reviews to identify areas for improvement and confirm data destruction.
