# Gitea Initial Proposal and Tentative Implementation Plan

## Summary of Benefits

Gitea, an open-source Git repository management system, offers several benefits when hosted on-premises locally as a Version Control System (VCS):

- **Change Control:** Git and Gitea offer the ability to run changes to SOPs, policies and any other documentation through a Change Control approver (or approvers) before being committed. 

- **Version Control:** In the event that a change needs to be reverted, Gitea has an extensive history search to roll back to previous versions of documents.

- **Data Control:** On-premises hosting provides complete control over your documentation, ensuring data security and compliance with internal policies and regulations.

- **Workflow Management:** Many implementations of Git services, such as Gitea, offer task management, assignment and logging functions for improved operational management organization. 

- **Workflow Management:** Documents can be linked together via hyperlink to point to boilerplate data, so instead of having to maintain several documents with similar sections, the redundant section/steps/data can be pulled out, linked and maintained as a single document. 

- **Customization:** Gitea can be customized to match your organization's specific requirements, including integration with existing tools and workflows.

- **Offline Access:** Developers can access and work on repositories even without an internet connection.

## Tentative Implementation Plan

**Infrastructure Setup:**
- [ ] Choose a dedicated server or VM with adequate resources (CPU, RAM, storage) 
- [ ] Install a suitable operating system (Linux distributions like CentOS, Ubuntu, or Debian are common choices).

**Install Docker (Optional):**
- [ ] For easier deployment, consider installing Docker on the server. Gitea can run as a Docker container.

**Install Gitea:**
- [ ] Download the Gitea binary or Docker image from the official website or repository.
- [ ] Configure Gitea by specifying repository storage paths, database settings (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL), and other preferences. Ensure you follow the official documentation for detailed setup instructions.

**Set Up Reverse Proxy (Optional):**
- [ ] Configure a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Apache to handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and route them to the Gitea application.

**User and Access Management:**
- [ ] Create user accounts for your team within Gitea.
- [ ] Define permissions and access controls based on roles and responsibilities.

**Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
- [ ] Implement regular backups of your Gitea data, including repositories, configurations, and databases.
- [ ] Develop a disaster recovery plan to ensure data integrity in case of server failures.

**Security Measures:**
- [ ] Implement security best practices, including firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and encryption (HTTPS).
- [ ] Regularly update Gitea and its dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools to track server health, performance, and user activities.
- [ ] Configure logging to capture and analyze events for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

**User Training and Documentation:**
- [ ] Provide training to your development team on using Gitea effectively.
- [ ] Create documentation to guide users on common tasks and best practices.

**Scale and Maintain:**
- [ ] As your codebase grows or your team expands, consider scaling your infrastructure accordingly.
- [ ] Continuously maintain and update Gitea to benefit from new features and security enhancements.

**User Support:**
- [ ] Establish a support system for addressing user queries and issues related to Gitea.
