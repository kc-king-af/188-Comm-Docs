# Initial Proposal and Tentative Plan for Vault Key Management for Service Accounts

<mark>NOTE: THIS IS IN PROGRESS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A COMPLETE PLAN</mark>

## Summary
HashiCorp Vault is an open-source, enterprise-class secret and key management tool that provides secure storage, management, and access control for secrets, including cryptographic keys.

Utilizing HashiCorp Vault's key management system (KMS) for password management, encryption, and role-based access control (RBAC) for service accounts and services may be able to greatly enhance our security posture. 

Below is an implementation plan to achieve this:

### Features

Here are some key details about HashiCorp Vault:

* License: HashiCorp Vault is released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0), which is an open-source license.

* Features: HashiCorp Vault offers a wide range of features, including secret storage, dynamic secret generation with randomness and entropy, data encryption, access controls, and integration with various cloud providers and authentication methods.

* Community and Support: It has an active community of users and contributors, which means you can find extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support.

## Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
- [ ] HashiCorp Vault server downloaded, installed and configured with backend storage or filesystem.
- [ ] Appropriate authentication methods configured (e.g., token-based, LDAP, AWS IAM, etc.).
- [ ] Service accounts and services that require secure password management.
- [ ] Basic understanding of Vault's policies and access controls.
- [ ] Vault's CLI or API as desired.

## Define Service Roles and Policies:

- [ ] Determine the roles and permissions that different services and service accounts require within Vault.
- [ ] Create Vault policies that define what actions and secrets each role can access.
  - Example: Create policies like read-service1-secrets, read-write-service2-secrets, etc.

## Enable the Key-Value (KV) Secret Engine:

- [ ] Initialize and enable the KV secret engine to store your service account passwords securely.
- [ ] Configure different KV paths for different service accounts and services if needed.
- [ ] "Unseal" the vault using necessary key shares and thresholds.

## Establish Network Connection and Authentication

- [ ] Configure networked client access to Vault for access requests
- [ ] Implement process on your on-prem server that fetches passwords from Vault and encrypts them using a strong encryption method.

## Configure a Backup and Recovery Solution:
- [ ] <mark>TODO</mark> verify it will work with BU-Exec

## Create and Store Service Account Passwords:

- [ ] Use Vault to generate strong, random passwords and/or secrets for each service account.
- [ ] Store these passwords securely in the KV secret engine under the appropriate paths.
- [ ] Use Vault's dynamic secrets feature to periodically rotate these passwords for added security.

## Encrypt Passwords for Local Storage:
- [ ] Store the encrypted passwords locally on the server in a secure manner (e.g., a dedicated directory with restricted permissions).

## Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

- [ ] Configure Vault's RBAC policies to grant access to services just-in-time when they need it.
- [ ] Create roles that map services to Vault policies and define their access capabilities.
- [ ] Utilize Vault's JWT authentication for service authentication if applicable.

## Automate RBAC Grants:

- [ ] Implement automation scripts or workflows that allow services to request access to secrets and RBAC roles.
- [ ] These scripts should interact with Vault's API to dynamically create role bindings for services.

## Audit and Logging:

- [ ] Implement auditing and logging for all Vault activities, especially those related to secret retrieval, RBAC grants, and changes to policies.

## Periodic Review and Rotation:

- [ ] Establish a schedule for periodically reviewing and rotating service account passwords, RBAC roles, and policies.
- [ ] Automate the rotation process as much as possible.

## Monitoring and Alerts:

- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for unusual activities within Vault, such as repeated access requests or unauthorized access attempts.
- [ ] Integrate with a SIEM system for real-time monitoring.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery:

- [ ] Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery strategy for Vault, ensuring that you can recover secrets and configurations in case of failures or data loss.

## Documentation and Training:

- [ ] Document the entire setup, including policies, RBAC roles, and procedures for service accounts and services to interact with Vault.
- [ ] Provide training to relevant personnel on how to use and manage Vault securely.

## Testing:

- [ ] Thoroughly test the implementation in a controlled environment before deploying it to production.

## Maintenance, Compliance and Security Audits:

- [ ] Regularly undergo security audits and compliance assessments to ensure that your Vault implementation adheres to industry standards and best practices.
- [ ] Review Vault Releases for regular security updates.

## Continuous Improvement:

- [ ] Continuously monitor and improve your Vault implementation based on lessons learned and changes in security best practices.

Remember that this plan should be tailored to your organization's specific needs and requirements. Regularly review and update your Vault implementation to stay ahead of security threats and evolving best practices.

##  Summary

Remember that this plan would require additional effort to configure to our organization's specific needs and requirements. It may also require regular review of our Vault implementation to stay ahead of security threats and evolving best practices.
