# BP Service Account Management Concepts

Handling non-human (service) privileged accounts is a crucial aspect of privileged account management (PAM) in cybersecurity. These accounts are often associated with applications, systems, or services and have elevated permissions that must be carefully controlled. Here are some best practices for handling non-human privileged accounts:

## Inventory and Identification
Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all non-human privileged accounts.
Clearly label and document each account's purpose, owner, and associated systems or services.

## Least Privilege Principle (PoLP)
Apply the principle of least privilege to non-human accounts, ensuring they have only the minimum level of access required to perform their functions.
Regularly review and update permissions to align with changing business needs.

## Secure Credential Storage
Store credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys, certificates) securely, such as in a password vault or key management system.
Implement strong encryption and access controls to protect stored credentials from unauthorized access.

## Regular Password Rotation
Enforce regular password rotation for non-human accounts to reduce the risk of credential compromise.
Use automation to update passwords and ensure minimal disruption to services.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Implement MFA for non-human accounts whenever possible to add an additional layer of security.
Ensure that MFA methods are well-documented and maintained.

## Access Monitoring and Auditing
Enable comprehensive logging and auditing for non-human accounts, capturing all relevant activities and events.
Set up real-time alerts for suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.

## Access Control and Segmentation
Segment network access to restrict non-human accounts to the necessary systems and services.
Implement network and firewall rules to limit lateral movement in case of a breach.

## Automated Remediation
Set up automated response and remediation mechanisms to address security incidents involving non-human accounts.
Automated responses can include disabling or isolating compromised accounts.

## Regular Review and Revocation
Conduct periodic reviews of non-human accounts to verify their continued necessity.
Decommission or revoke access for accounts that are no longer needed.

## Change Management and Documentation
Implement a robust change management process for non-human accounts, including tracking and documenting changes to permissions and configurations.
Maintain up-to-date documentation on the purpose, usage, and configuration of each non-human account.

## Training and Awareness
Educate relevant personnel about the existence and importance of non-human privileged accounts.
Ensure that IT and development teams are aware of and follow best practices for managing these accounts.

## Incident Response Planning
Develop an incident response plan specific to non-human account breaches or compromises.
Clearly define roles and responsibilities for responding to incidents involving these accounts.

## Regular Security Assessments
Conduct security assessments, such as penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify weaknesses in the management of non-human accounts.
Address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

## Compliance and Reporting
Ensure that the management of non-human privileged accounts aligns with relevant compliance requirements and standards.
Generate reports and audit trails for compliance purposes.

## Vendor and Third-Party Accounts
Pay special attention to non-human accounts associated with third-party vendors or cloud services.
Verify and monitor the security practices of these external entities.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, organizations can enhance the security and integrity of service accounts, reducing the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access to critical systems and data.
